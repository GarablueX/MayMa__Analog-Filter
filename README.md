🎛️ **MayMa**
MayMa is my personal analog synthesizer project — a fully hand-designed, TL071-based analog circuit powered by ±12 V.
This project documents its complete journey: from schematic design and Proteus testing to Eurorack conversion, Altium integration, and final hardware assembly.

### Board Quality Highlights

* The silkscreen is rendered with **exceptional clarity and contrast** against the solder mask, making component placement and labeling immediately readable.
* Copper traces exhibit **crisp definition and precise routing**, with consistent widths and clean transitions.
* A **premium, uniform surface finish** across the entire board, reflecting high-quality materials and manufacturing standards.
* Potentiometer and terminal holes are drilled with **micron-level accuracy**, ensuring perfect mechanical alignment during assembly.
* Board edges are **smooth, clean, and professionally finished**, with no burrs or roughness.
* Overall **dimensional accuracy and alignment are flawless**, confirming excellent fabrication tolerances.

This PCB quality provides a solid foundation for reliable assembly, repeatable testing, and long-term durability during real-world operation.

## 🧭 Project Roadmap

| Stage                                                | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1️⃣ Schematics & Troubleshooting (Proteus + PCB)** | Designing, simulating, and debugging the full circuit in Proteus, followed by initial PCB layout and signal verification.   |
| **2️⃣ Eurorack Adaptation**                          | Converting the design for the Eurorack modular synth standard (±12 V rails, 3.5 mm jacks, 3U panel format).                 |
| **3️⃣ Altium Integration**                           | Migrating the schematic and layout into Altium Designer for refined routing, labeling, and front-panel artwork integration. |
| **4️⃣ Hardware & Assembly (Real-Life Testing)**      | Building, soldering, and evaluating the physical module — measuring audio response, CV behavior, and resonance stability.   |

## 🧪 Testing

1. Power with ±12 V — verify the power LED is on.
2. Feed a 10 V p-p test signal into AUDIO IN.
3. Sweep CV IN between 0 – 9.5 V (slow triangle or DC ramp).
4. Observe tone and resonance behavior on the output.
